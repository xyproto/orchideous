# Raylib 5 — Bouncing Circles

A modern replacement for the old EntityX + SFML2 example.

500 coloured circles bounce around the screen. When two collide they
explode into a shower of fading particles. Uses a data-oriented
struct-of-arrays layout — the contemporary way to organise entity data
in C++ without pulling in a heavyweight ECS framework.
